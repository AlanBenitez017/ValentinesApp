ValentinesApp 💖
A fun and interactive app to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine! 🌹

📜 About the App
This app playfully asks my girlfriend to be my Valentine. She can click yes and can choose a date from different options, or she can click "No" and the button will jump on the screen a few times before the "No" button dissapears, and she does not have a choice.

Before confirming the date, she can:
✔️ Confirm the date and seal the deal.
🎥 Watch a related YouTube video before making a decision.

📱 Features
✅ Playful Interaction: She must tap "No" multiple times before "Yes" appears.
🎉 Date Selection: Choose from different romantic date options.
🎥 YouTube Integration: Option to watch a video before confirming.
💌 Sealed Confirmation: Once confirmed, the date is locked in!
